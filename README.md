## Development

Getting started with development is fairly straight forward:

### Prerequisites

You will need `git` installed locally to clone this repository.

You will need `Node >= 6` installed on your machine. If you don't have Node
installed [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is an excellent version
manager for node.

### Running the app

To run a local version of the app, checkout this repo and `cd` into the `bingo`
directory. Install the app dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

Once the above is finished, start the app with:
```
npm start
```

You should now be able to access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Running the tests

Run the tests with the following command (note: make sure you've run `npm install` first):

```
npm test
```
